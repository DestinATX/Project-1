5/26/20 - Met 7:30-10:30pm, reviewed APIs, acquired keys, developed next steps, recorded data
Decisions:  Google Maps & Distance Matrix + OpenWeather APIs; Bootstrap replacement will be Materialize https://materializecss.com/
Next Meeting: Agile Update at 8pm Wednesday (5/27)
Assignments - return API how-to for cost, duration, distance for Google APIs
  1.  Google Maps API - Daniel & Adrian 
  2.  Google Distance Matrix - Marlon & Diane (hint: shortest vs quickest route) + OpenWeather
       https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/distance-matrix/start
  3.  All to review OpenWeather and come with ideas for storyboarding
* Note:  use google to scrape this data instead of using Lyft and Uber APIs or use Google APIs to get their data.

Other Research Projects - slack if you are working on any of theses projects
- Method for calculating cost, duration, distance for bikes
- Modals - research as replacement for alerts
- Review Project Plan guidelines found in Antonio's Presentation

Goal:  Target MVP on Monday (Jun1), Final Presentation Tuesday (Jun9)
