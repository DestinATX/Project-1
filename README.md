This is an application that will help a user select the most optimal transportation method to get to a desired destination.

Implement five APIs to give choices to the user.

*Uber API

*BikeRadar API
*Open Weather API
*Google Maps API

With these APIs user will be able to find the most affordable way to get to a desired destination in Austin.
We recommend the user to use environmentally friendly vehicles on sunny days.
