FoodTrucksATX
Designed for users of all ages to determine the available food trucks in the user’s desired area of Austin, TX then allowing them to choose to walk, bike, take public transit, or personal car based on their desired time to arrival.

User Stories
Ask a friend/relative to give us feedback to answer user type, goal of app effectiveness, and benefit (1 video clip or words – need 2-3)

Acceptance Criteria
• Given I am within the City of Austin in search of a food truck, I am able to find options in the area of town that I wish to target.
• If I desire a particular cuisine, the FoodTrucksATX app allows me to search by cuisine with results provided for desired mode of transportation.
• Given options to walk, bike, take public transit, or personal car, I am able to select the desired food trucks in that vacinity.
• When I select the option to walk or bike, weather conditions presented.
• Then I expect the address, directions, map, duration of the trip, and short bio on the food truck I select.

Bugs and Rabbit Holes

- Began defining “destinATX, a transportation application but after several days were not able to gain access to Uber and Lyft APIs so redirected efforts to focus on FoodTrucksATX
- Used proxy to fix CORS error which was blocking data from Google Direction API
  3 Ways to Fix the CORS Error — and How Access-Control-Allow-Origin works
- Found work around for Geo-location, need approval for Alert to user requesting permission

audit trail information would be helpful, diagrams, screen shots, notes, etc.
